# About
---
This package uses your idle web-cam as a video recording device. Video recording is triggered based on motion and is data/time stamped. The intention is to develop a smart camera software that can be monitored remotely. I had made a simple UI using QT, the source code is made available so that you can modify and test on your own. If you run into any issues, feel free to contact me. Cheers!
